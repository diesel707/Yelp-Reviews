# Yelp-Reviews
Yelp is a social networking site that lets users post reviews and rate businesses. When you go to a new restaurant and have a good experience, it's likely that you won't keep the place a secret.
Yelp enters a new market and begins creating profiles for local businesses (what they call 'claimed business locations'). 
Users then begin to write reviews, which in turn spurs user adoption and more reviews, creating a snowball effect until Yelp becomes the definitive guide to local businesses in their market.
The algorithm determines the rating of a review from 1-5 based on the review given as an input.
